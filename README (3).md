# (COMMUNICATING DATA FINDINGS OF AN EXPLORATORY DATASET OF PISA 2012)
## by (Oluwashina Dedenuola)

## Dataset

PISA evaluates the degree to which 15-year-old students have learned fundamental concepts and abilities necessary for active participation in contemporary societies. Reading, science, and problem-solving were lightly evaluated in the PISA 2012 survey, which was primarily focused on mathematics.

In this project, I selected columns of the datasets which I had interest in while dropping the other columns. I then went further to clean the data I had interest in by removing outliers and errors from the dataset. I also removed null values to ensure that the visualization was accurate.

## Summary of Findings

The gender distribution of students reveals that there were more female students than male students. eventhough it is almost evenly distributed by gender.

The majority of students who took part in the PISA program were from Mexico. Italy came in second place, and Qatar came in tenth place overall in terms of the number of students who participated.

As was already mentioned, it is clear that male and female share a similar level of interest in mathematics. However, this is not consistent with how much they enjoy math or math lessons.

According to the above result, female generally outperformed male in both reading and math, with a strong positive correlation between the two. This demonstrates that, despite the fact that most female students denied enjoying math, they performed better than the male. The scatter plot also reveals that a female outperformed a male in math while a female outperformed a male in reading.

The regplot suggests a positive weak regression line, which suggests that some students who are open to problem-solving have a tendency to perform very well on their math assessments.

The student test scores in math, science, and reading were further validated by the Pairgrid plot, which also expressed the relationship between three quantitative variables. While the histogram shows an 800 peak across all student scores, the scatter plot demonstrates positive correlation across the student scores. A symmetric short-tailed distribution across all student scores is also visible in the histogram.


## Key Insights for Presentation

I will be focusing on four main visualization, two from the Bivariate exploration and two from the Multivariate Exploration. 

I'll be focusing on the count plot, correlation and regression plots in the Bivariate which expressed a relationship between two variables and their distribution on the basis of gender. I wanted to know if the students performing well in one subject had a positive relationship on another. Then I will assess the Multivariate relationship between the student scores.
